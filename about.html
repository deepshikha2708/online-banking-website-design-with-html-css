        Empowering Rural Communities</h1>
    <p>Asaan was founded in 2023 with a singular vision â€“ to bridge the financial gap that often separates rural communities from economic growth and financial stability. Over the years, we have grown and evolved, but our unwavering commitment to rural development remains the cornerstone of our identity.
        The farmers mostly lives in the rural population and need credit for agricultural activities which has the following problems related to banks.
        Usually, the problem in the villages is, either there is an ATM of a particular bank or there is no ATM. In the first case, if there is an ATM, people using it will have to pay the ATM usage charges if they are non-members of the bank 
       In the second case they will have to travel long distances and then the scenario might be same as the first case. 
       Agricultural and non-agricultural activity in rural areas are typically seasonal, and households need credit to smooth out seasonal fluctuations in earnings and expenditure.
